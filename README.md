# Platformar
## This will be very basic. Mostly to see how well I can make this function as a whole.
This will be a **simple platformer** where *levels* can be easily implemented with
specific blocks, so object oriented programming is perfect for this type of game.
It will be great for people who are just looking for a quick game to kill time with
for a short while. This project is something that I want to be able to try to make
since I love playing games myself, so taking my shot at making one would be a good 
experience for me to see if it is something I want to continue doing.


## **User stories** (things I plan on implementing)
- As a user, I want to be able to obtain collectibles and have the obtained collectibles *added* to a list.
- As a user, I want to be able to choose from a *list* of different levels that I have completed already.
- As a user, I want my movement to be quick and responsive.
- As a user, I want to see unique design for different levels.
- As a user, I want to have a specific goal to reach.
- As a user, I want to be able to pause the game whenever I need to by quitting and rerunning to be prompted if I want to continue where I left off.
- As a user, I have to be able to complete levels with a fair amount of challenge.
- As a user, I want my collectibles to be saved across multiple sessions and able to reset my list of them at any given time.
- As a user, I also want the same to apply to levels, where I can save, view, and reset the saved list.
