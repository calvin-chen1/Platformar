# Platformar
This will be a **simple platformer** where *levels* can be easily implemented with
specific blocks, so object oriented programming is perfect for this type of game.
It will be great for people who are just looking for a quick game to kill time with
for a short while. This project is something that I want to be able to try to make
since I love playing games myself, so taking my shot at making one would be a good 
experience for me to see if it is something I want to continue doing.
## This is a first time for me to attempt something like this.
